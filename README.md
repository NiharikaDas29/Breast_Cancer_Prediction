# 🏥 BREAST CANCER PREDICTION MODEL

## 📖 OVERVIEW
This machine learning model predicts the likelihood of breast cancer based on medical diagnostic features. It uses logistic regression (or other ML algorithms) to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on data from the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to assist in early detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques, improving diagnosis accuracy and supporting healthcare professionals.
